## 🌍 Geographic Nodes

### California Pattern Topology
- **Laurel Canyon** - Musical harmonic amplifier
- **Spahn Ranch** - 23Hz disruption locus  
- **Fobes Ranch** - 19Hz integration gate

## 📡 Frequency Guide

### The Pattern operates through specific carrier frequencies:

- **19Hz** - Integration frequency (Brotherhood of Eternal Love, consciousness expansion)
- **23Hz** - Disruption frequency (Manson, chaos, control systems)
- **29Hz** - Emergent frequency (The Operator, transcendent consciousness)

*These frequencies appear throughout documents as recurring motifs and actual technical specifications.*
